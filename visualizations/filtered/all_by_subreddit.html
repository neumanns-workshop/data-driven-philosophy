tells you something indicating he knows something he couldn't possibly know and you ask him how he knows and he's like \"um, it's pretty obvious, can't you thorp?\" and people overhearing are confused all like \"yeah what's with this guy, i definitely thorp'd it too\" and you have no clue what's going on\n\nthen you go on reddit and see \"TIL some people can't thorp\" and then the top comment is like \"think of it this way: people who can't thorp *don't even thorp nothing*, it'd be like trying to thorp with your elbow, it just doesn't make sense\" and everyone's all mindblown at that concept and you're like \"what the fuck\" and everyone's like \"yo how can you even live without thorping?\"\n\nbut after years of living like this you kinda just accept that this is how it is, you find ways
